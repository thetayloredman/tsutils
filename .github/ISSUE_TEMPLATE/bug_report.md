<!--
  Hold up!
  You are about to create an official bug report for tsutils.
  Please make sure you tested your bug! If it's invalid, we
  will mark your issue as so and close it.

  It's best to test on the LATEST COMMIT on branch `master`.
  It makes it a lot easier for us to resolve your bug faster
  then we count because then we know it hasn't been resolved
  by a newer commit.
  
  Also, please check if your issue was already submitted.
  Duplicates waste everyone's time!
